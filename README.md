🔪 Hi, I’m Michael Cooper
Full-Stack Developer | Code Surgeon | Brand Architect

I slice through bugs and craft pixel-perfect web apps for startups and SMBs, turning technical chaos into clean, scalable code. With 8+ years of freelancing, I’ve built 50+ full-stack apps (React, Node.js, Python) and rescued 100+ websites from the brink of disaster.

What I Do Best:
✅ Full-Stack Development: From MVP builds to complex SaaS tools—code that works and impresses.
✅ Emergency Debugging: Fix React errors, Node.js crashes, or API meltdowns in 24 hours or less.
✅ Brand Scalpel: Design-dev hybrids. I engineer websites and brand identities that convert.

When I’m not coding, I’m live-streaming on Twitch, breaking down “how to ship faster” on YouTube, or geeking out with my 1.5k+ Discord dev community. Oh, and I’m wrapping up my B.S. in Computer Science (Eastern Washington University) to keep my edge razor-sharp.

Why Work With Me?
